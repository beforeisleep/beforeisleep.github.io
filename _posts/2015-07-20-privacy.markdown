The notion of privacy has always been somewhat foreign to me. The privacy issues are often cited in mass media: NSA spying on US citizens, celebrities making their children off-limits to tabloids, with organization such as EFF fighting, everyday, to secure out privacy, our only today, but for our future. Having said that, these news didn't carry much urgency - at least to me - mostly because 1) the people who are affected are not the ordinary citizens, but are the likes of journalists, political dissidents, and celebrities, or 2) it is difficult to imagine how, concretely, the loss of privacy affects our lives in the future.

Wikipedia defines 'privacy' as:
