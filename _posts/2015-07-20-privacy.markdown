Privacy has always been a distant topic to me although privacy issues are widely covered in media: NSA's spying on US citizens, privacy of celebrities' children, leaks of intimate photographs in social media, LGBT's fight against Facebook's 'Real Name Policy'. People, affiliate groups, and organizations such as (EFF)[https://www.eff.org/] are fighting to secure their privacy, and ours, now and for our future. 

This may be because it is difficult for me to imagine how, concretely, the loss of privacy may possibly play out in my life. I do not belong to such groups and communities that are often cited: journalists, political dissidents, celebrities or LGBT community. Furthermore, I have always felt that the focus of the discussions, over time, tend to drift towards broader agenda surrounding these groups. What about those leaked pictures? Again, what come to the forefront, in my view, are the decency of the online communities, social networks and their participants, and discussions around specific harassments (e.g. revenge porn) and the freedom of speech. Besides, SnapChat solves the problem, right? I can control my privacy if I ever needed to, right?

I understand, intellectually, what privacy is about, and that it matters. I understand that it is a big deal. But I have not fought for our privacy that is being chipped away with or without our knowledge or consent. I have not payed enough attention to how well we are - or we are not - equipped to be in control of our privacy.

The goal of this blog is to talk about privacy in ways that are much more 'real'. Maybe if I talk about it, maybe I, and the readers, get to 'feel' why privacy matters. If I am lucky, maybe I can help contribute to making privacy a household topic.

But why me? Why now?

Because I am being stalked.
